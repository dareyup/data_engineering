# ETL Process
1. Data is extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu) locally
2. The [starbucks_menu_db.ipynb](https://github.com/dareyup/data_engineering/blob/main/Starbucks%20Menu/starbucks_menu_db.ipynb) initiates a connection to PostgreSQL and creates the database with auto-commit
3. Tables are created with columns and data types
4. Cleaned data is inserted into new tables
